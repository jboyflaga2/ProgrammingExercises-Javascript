## This tutorial is from https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/

This is a summary of that tutorial. I put/copied it here becuase  that tutorial might change in the future.


## 1. see folder "1-Introduction"

## 2. see folder "2-TheHeroEditor"

## 3. see folder "3-Master_Detail"

## 4. see folder "4-MultipleComponents"

## 5. Services - We create a reusable service to manage our hero data calls

Because data services are invariably asynchronous, we'll finish the chapter with a Promise-based version of the data service.

### Keep the app transpiling and running
```
npm start
```
